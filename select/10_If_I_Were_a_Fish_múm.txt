If I were a fish and you were a seashell
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my babies?

If I were a fish
If I were a fish
(Lalala: lalala: lalala: lalala)

If I were a bumblebee and you were a puddle
Would I drown in you anyway?
In your soggy eyeballs?

If I were a fish
If I were a fish
(Lalala: lalala: lalala: lalala)

If I were a fish
And you were a puddle
If I were a fish
